# thesisData

Here you can find the data obtained from the test of Picnic Signature Scheme with key blinding which is in the by running
https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/zeynep.sonkaya/gnunet/-/blob/master/src/util/test_crypto_pqc_gnsrecord.c
and  from the test of ECC Signature Schemes(ECDSA and EDDSA) with key blinding by running
https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/zeynep.sonkaya/gnunet/-/blob/master/src/util/test_crypto_ecc_gnsrecord.c.

The data is given in a Raw version in the files:
- testResultRaw.csv for  Picnic Signature Scheme with key blinding 
- testResultEcc.csv for ECC Signature Schemes with key blinding

The testResult.ods includes these data in a form can be used with the plotSignatureData.py by merging, transposing and  seperating to the sheets for all different data group
